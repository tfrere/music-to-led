**Music 2 Led** is an **open source program** that allows you to create **real-time audio and midi visualizations on led strips** using Arduino and Python. It was designed for **DJ**'s, **music groups** or **artists** who want to add some **automated lighting effects** to their shows.

All you need is a **computer** _( works on Raspi 4 )_, an **arduino** and a **ws2812b led strip**.
